## Introduction
The grep-like utility in Python aims to provide users with a simplified, yet powerful tool for searching patterns within text. Drawing inspiration from the Unix grep command, this utility incorporates various regular expression features to enhance pattern matching capabilities.

## Goals and Objectives
* **Pattern Matching**: Enable users to search for specific patterns within input text.
* **Regular Expression Support**: Support a range of regex features like anchors, quantifiers, wildcards, and alternation.
* **Ease of Use**: Provide a simple command-line interface for users to input their search patterns.
* **Performance**: Ensure efficient pattern matching for large datasets.

## System Overview
The system comprises a command-line interface (CLI) that interacts with a backend Python script responsible for parsing input patterns and performing pattern matching against provided text.

## Architectural Components

#### CLI Interface
* Accepts user input for text and search patterns.
* Interfaces with the backend for pattern matching.
* Displays results to the user.

#### Pattern Matcher
* Core logic for parsing and interpreting regex patterns.
* Utilizes Python's re library for efficient pattern matching.
* Handles pattern matching for provided text.

#### Input Processor
* Handles reading of input text from standard input or files.
* Sends text to the Pattern Matcher for matching.

## Data Flow
1. User inputs text and pattern via the CLI.
2. Input Processor reads the text.
3. Pattern Matcher parses and interprets the pattern.
4. Matcher performs pattern matching on the text.
5. Results are displayed to the user via the CLI.

### Usage Examples
To search for the word `"cat"` in a text:

```
$ echo "The cat sat on the mat" | ./app/main.py -E "cat"
```

For more complex patterns:

```
$ echo "apple orange banana" | ./app/main.py -E "(apple|banana)"
```

## Future Enhancements
* Support for additional regex features.
* Integration with other command-line tools.
* Performance optimizations for large datasets.


## Conclusion
The grep-like utility provides a user-friendly interface for powerful text pattern matching in Python. By leveraging the rich set of regex features, it caters to a wide range of text search requirements with ease.

This design document serves as a blueprint for the grep-like utility, ensuring clarity in its architecture and functionality.
